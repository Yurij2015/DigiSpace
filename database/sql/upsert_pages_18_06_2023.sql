<p>Template implementation helps to show render data as HTML through examples of code. This comes in handy, when you want to visualize some data, i.e., which is delivered from the server or a database. Typically, templates combine HTML with special tags and help the development team to build the design of a website or app according to a template. By using HTML templates, we achieve a couple of goals like as follows:</p>
<ul class="list-marked list_inset">
<li>Create a vision of how the product will look and which features should be implemented via templates.</li>
<li>Deliver the specifics of server-side data via web template layout.</li>
<li>Provide a customer with a preliminary look at the product via HTML implementation of templates.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Which Technologies and Methods Do We Use in Template Implementation</h4>

<li>The ability to scale the product up and provide more innovations in the future. That is bingo for growing businesses which have goals for further scaling up.</li>
<li>Easier integration with other products. When the code is outdated, and it has low interoperability, it&rsquo;s a catastrophe. Legacy code refactoring helps to cope with this problem.</li>
